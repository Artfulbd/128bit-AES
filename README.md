# 128bit-AES

Usage: java AES_Cipher.java plaintext.txt

Executing the above command will create two outputs: 

	1) the encrypted content of the file as "crypto.txt" 

	2) the decrypted content of the encrypted file as "cleartext.txt"

Note: If any file other than plaintext.txt is used as input, "plaintext.txt" in the readFile function must be replaced with that file name in line 30 of the code.
